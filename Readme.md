Documentation:
1. This library contains a number of functions.
2. These functions are fairly basic, given my level of JS knowledge and the theme of my document.
3. The functions mostly perform iterations through arrays, from .filter to .forEach to .sort to .reverse, and they spit out names, occupations, roles, etc.
4. There are more than 160 lines of JS code.
5. The coding has been cleaned up several times using JSHint. I've also reduced some coding to make it simpler/easy to read.
6. Information is included in notes mode to denote the purpose of each function.
7. Information is tabbed for easy reading.
