      <p>This is the story of my family. Well, it's not so much a story. It's basically a bunch of coding, just thematically tied to my family. This way, you'll get to know my family, and I'll get to know some coding. Especially JavaScript coding, which I still suck at. But I'm improving. Slowly. Very. Slowly.
      <p> But back to my family. We moved to Key West (see picture, above) in 1983, and we spent many days playing sports or basking in the sun's rays. We're an entrepreneurial, creative, right-brained bunch. Other than my Dad, we all pretty much stink at math. So to pay homage to math, click the button below to display a random meaningless number:</p>
      
        <button onclick="myFunction()">The bad-ass Blatt button</button>
            <p id="blattMath"></p>

      </ul>
       <p> Wasn't that fun? I could click that button all day. Not really. OK, you'll get a kick at the following button. It returns a random family member's name. It's way cool (not really). What's way cool is that I could get it to work.</p>
